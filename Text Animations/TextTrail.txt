Component: TextTrail
Category: text\_animation / hero / background

Visual: Bold, center‑fitted word rendered as glowing raster text with a trailing/ghosting smear that gently distorts like fluid. Fills its container; text scales to the shortest side.
Behavior: WebGL shader persists previous frames to create a motion trail; simplex noise jitters the trail; mouse/touch position subtly warps the smear; optional timed color cycling or fixed color.

Good for: hero headline, section headers, event/launch banners
Avoid for: paragraphs/body copy, dense dashboards, accessibility‑critical headings without a plain fallback

Website types: creative portfolios, gaming/esports, tech/SaaS, digital agencies

Dependencies: react, three
Performance: medium‑heavy (RTT + shaders; supersample and large containers increase cost)
Mobile: yes (tested with pointer events), but prefer smaller containers and lower supersample on low‑end devices

Container: Must have explicit size (e.g., className="w-full h-\[400px]" or a relative parent with fixed height). Renders a full‑bleed canvas; works best on darker backgrounds. For Next.js, load client‑side only (dynamic import with ssr\:false).
