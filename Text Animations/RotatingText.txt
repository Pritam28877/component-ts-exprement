Component: RotatingText
Category: text\_animation / hero / interaction

Visual: A pill/badge‑style text block where the displayed phrase swaps to the next one via per‑character slide (e.g., from 100% → 0 → −120%). Each word/char is masked by overflow for a crisp, marquee‑like flip. Size and styles come from your classes.
Behavior: Cycles through `texts[]` automatically (or via exposed `next/previous/jumpTo/reset` ref). Splits by characters/words/lines; applies staggered Motion transitions from configurable origins (`first/last/center/random/index`). Supports spring tuning, Presence modes, and custom intervals.

Good for: rotating taglines, feature highlights, testimonial snippets
Avoid for: long paragraphs, rapidly changing UIs where constant motion distracts, SEO‑critical H1 without a static fallback

Website types: SaaS/marketing pages, product launches, portfolios, event microsites

Dependencies: react, motion (Framer Motion’s `motion/react`)
Performance: light (DOM text + transforms/opacities; staggered animations)
Mobile: yes (auto rotation works; no hover required)
Container: Use an inline/flex wrapper with `overflow-hidden` on the main chip (already supported via `mainClassName`) and `overflow-hidden` on split rows (`splitLevelClassName`). Ensure sufficient line height/padding so characters can slide in/out cleanly; wrap in a relatively positioned parent if you layer other elements nearby.
