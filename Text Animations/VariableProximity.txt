Component: VariableProximity
Category: text\_animation / interaction

Visual: Text rendered with a variable font (e.g., Roboto Flex) where each letter dynamically changes weight, optical size, or other axes as the cursor or touch approaches. Size is inline text; inherits font size from parent.
Behavior: Each letter individually interpolates between two `font-variation-settings` values (`fromFontVariationSettings` → `toFontVariationSettings`) based on proximity to the pointer within a configurable radius, with linear, exponential, or Gaussian falloff. Updates in real time via `requestAnimationFrame`.

Good for: hero intros, interactive call‑to‑actions, playful headings
Avoid for: long‑form body text, performance‑critical pages with many concurrent animations, environments without variable‑font support

Website types: creative portfolios, interactive landing pages, experimental marketing sites

Dependencies: react, motion (Framer Motion’s `motion/react`), a variable font that exposes the referenced axes (e.g., Roboto Flex with `wght`, `opsz`)
Performance: medium (per‑letter proximity math each frame; scales with text length)
Mobile: yes (touch movement supported)

Container: Must be inside a relatively positioned parent with a `ref` passed as `containerRef`; make the container large enough to capture movement. Ensure the chosen variable font is loaded (e.g., import Roboto Flex) and supports the specified axes; provide a readable non‑variable fallback for accessibility/SSR.
