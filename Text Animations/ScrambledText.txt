Component: ScrambledText
Category: text\_animation / interaction

Visual: Paragraph set in a mono font where characters near your cursor briefly “garble” into punctuation, then resolve back to the original letters. Effect ripples around the pointer within a circular radius; text size is responsive (clamp 14–32px by default).
Behavior: On pointer move, each char within `radius` runs a GSAP ScrambleText tween whose duration scales by proximity; characters store their original value and re-scramble smoothly on every pass.

Good for: playful paragraph reveals, quotes/blurbs, interactive “about” sections
Avoid for: long-form articles, legal/docs, assistive-tech critical copy (can be distracting)

Website types: creative portfolios, studios/agencies, tech/art blogs

Dependencies: react, gsap, gsap/SplitText, gsap/ScrambleTextPlugin
Performance: light‑medium (per‑char bounds + small tweens; scales with text length)
Mobile: yes (Pointer Events work on touch; effect triggers around the finger)
Container: Place inside a readable-width wrapper (e.g., max-w-\[800px]) with sufficient padding. Use a monospace or evenly spaced font for a cleaner scramble look. Ensure foreground contrast; the component measures per‑char rects, so avoid heavy transforms on parent containers.
