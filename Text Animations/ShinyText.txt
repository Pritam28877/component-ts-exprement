Component: ShinyText
Category: text\_animation

Visual: Inline text with a semi-transparent silver/gray base color and a diagonal light-reflection effect sweeping across it, creating a “shimmer” or “shine” look. Size depends on the applied font size.
Behavior: Uses a CSS gradient background clipped to text; an animated keyframe moves the gradient from right to left on an infinite loop. Speed is adjustable via `speed` prop; can be disabled entirely.

Good for: hero headings, promotional banners, call-to-action text
Avoid for: long paragraphs, body copy, accessibility-critical text (reduced readability)
Website types: ecommerce, portfolios/creative, event/marketing pages

Dependencies: tailwindcss (with custom keyframes/animation config)
Performance: light
Mobile: yes
Container: Inline-block element; inherits font styling from parent; ensure background contrast so the shine effect is visible; avoid wrapping in containers with overflow hidden unless intentional to crop the shine.
