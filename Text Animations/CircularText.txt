Component: CircularText
Category: text\_animation/interaction

Visual: A 200×200px circular badge with characters arranged around the ring (bold, centered, white by default). Each letter is positioned radially to form a rotating text wheel.
Behavior: Auto-spins continuously using linear tween; on hover you can slowDown, speedUp, pause, or goBonkers (very fast + slight scale). Spin resumes to baseline on mouse leave.

Good for: hero seals/badges, CTA ornaments, logo locks
Avoid for: long sentences, dense content blocks, accessibility-critical primary headings
Website types: creative portfolios, SaaS marketing, event/brand sites

Dependencies: react, motion (motion/react)
Performance: light–medium (many absolutely positioned spans + continuous rotation)
Mobile: yes (hover effects won’t trigger; spin runs at baseline)
Container: The component renders a relative, rounded, 200×200 container; keep it square for symmetry. Ensure enough padding/contrast around it; avoid heavy parent transforms that may jitter continuous rotation.
