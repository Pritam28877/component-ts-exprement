Component: SplitText
Category: text\_animation/hero

Visual: Animated headline or sentence where characters/words/lines appear within their text box; typical heading size (e.g., h1–h3), inline-block with overflow-hidden to mask motion.
Behavior: Splits text into chars/words/lines and animates each from {opacity:0, y:40} to {opacity:1, y:0} with stagger; triggers once on scroll into view (ScrollTrigger) using threshold/rootMargin; fires onLetterAnimationComplete when the timeline finishes.

Good for: hero headlines, section titles, key callouts
Avoid for: long paragraphs, dense body copy, rapidly changing live text
Website types: marketing/landing pages, SaaS product sites, portfolios

Dependencies: react, gsap, gsap/ScrollTrigger, gsap/SplitText
Performance: light–medium (staggered transforms/opacity on multiple nodes)
Mobile: yes (scroll-triggered, touch-safe)

Container: Inline-block text element with overflow-hidden; parent can be any layout, but ensure sufficient viewport space for ScrollTrigger (e.g., not inside overflow-hidden ancestors that clip scroll); for splitType="lines", the element becomes position\:relative to support absolute line wrapping.
