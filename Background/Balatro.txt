Component: Balatro
Category: background/hero/interaction

Visual: Swirling, painterly vortex/ink effect with a subtle pixelated mosaic (from `pixelFilter`); fills whatever size the parent provides.
Behavior: GLSL distortion that spins and warps colors; optional auto-rotation (`isRotate`), live speed/angle modulation from mouse (`mouseInteraction`), and tunable contrast/lighting/color ramps.

Good for: hero, section backgrounds, banners
Avoid for: dense text blocks, long-form reading, data tables/forms
Website types: creative/agency portfolio, music/events, gaming/tech SaaS

Dependencies: react, ogl
Performance: medium–heavy (full-screen fragment shader; reduce resolution/pixelFilter/spinSpeed on low-end devices)
Mobile: yes

Container: A relatively positioned element with explicit width/height (e.g., `width:100%`, `height:500–800px`); the canvas is appended inside `.balatro-container`. Ensure sufficient overlay contrast for any foreground content.
