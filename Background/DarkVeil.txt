Component: DarkVeil
Category: background

Visual: Full-bleed canvas with a dark, shifting “digital nebula”/CRT-film veil; subtle color drift, scanlines, film grain; scales to container size.
Behavior: Procedural fragment-shader pattern driven by time; optional hue shift, noise, scanline attenuation, and spatial warp; animates continuously, responsive to resize; no user interaction.

Good for: hero backgrounds, section dividers, loading/transition backdrops
Avoid for: dense text blocks, data tables, form-heavy sections
Website types: gaming/esports, creative portfolios, music/entertainment, devtools/SaaS with cyber/tech branding

Dependencies: ogl
Performance: medium (can become heavy with high resolution or DPR)
Mobile: yes
Container: Parent must be position\:relative with fixed height (e.g., 400–800px) and width:100%; canvas fills parent; place foreground content in an absolutely positioned overlay (z-index above), consider lowering resolutionScale (0.75–0.9) for mobile and keeping high-contrast text.
