Component: Aurora
Category: background/hero

Visual: Soft, translucent aurora bands with a horizontal color ramp; fills its container (full-bleed if container is full-screen).
Behavior: Procedural GLSL noise creates flowing vertical “curtains”; speed, amplitude, blend, and color stops control motion, intensity, and softness.

Good for: hero, section-backgrounds, banners
Avoid for: text-heavy content blocks, dense forms, data tables
Website types: SaaS landing, creative portfolio, music/events

Dependencies: react, ogl
Performance: medium (GPU shader; fine on most laptops/modern phones)
Mobile: yes

Container: Place inside a parent with explicit width/height (e.g., w-full h-\[500px] or fullscreen). The canvas is transparent; set the parent’s background as needed.
