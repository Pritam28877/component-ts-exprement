Component: DotGrid
Category: background/interaction

Visual: Dense, evenly spaced circular dot matrix that fills its container; dots are small (configurable) and centered with equal gaps.
Behavior: Dots tint toward the active color when the cursor is nearby; fast pointer movement pushes dots with inertia, then they spring back; click/tap emits a radial “shockwave” that displaces nearby dots before they return.

Good for: hero backdrops, feature banners, loading/holding sections
Avoid for: text-heavy article bodies, form-heavy pages, critical performance views

Website types: tech SaaS, creative studios/portfolios, product marketing pages

Dependencies: gsap, gsap/InertiaPlugin
Performance: medium
Mobile: no (tap triggers shock only; no continuous hover/drag without touch handlers)
Container: Parent must have explicit width & height and position: relative (e.g., style={{ width: '100%', height: '600px', position: 'relative' }}); the component’s canvas is absolutely positioned to cover the container.
