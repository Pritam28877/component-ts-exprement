Component: Ballpit
Category: background/hero/interaction

Visual: Full-bleed 3D “ball pit” of glossy spheres in a box; fills its parent (e.g., 500px height)
Behavior: Physics-driven spheres bounce, collide, and react to the cursor (raycast-controlled attractor/light); optional pause and count control in code

Good for: hero sections, playful background canvases, interactive showcases
Avoid for: text-heavy/form sections, high-contrast readability areas, performance-critical pages with many animations
Website types: creative portfolios, product/brand landing pages, gaming/entertainment

Dependencies: three, gsap
Performance: medium (200 balls) → heavy at high counts (O(n²) collisions)
Mobile: yes (pointer events work), but reduce count for performance
Container: A relatively positioned block with fixed height and overflow hidden (e.g., style={{position:'relative', overflow:'hidden', minHeight:'500px', maxHeight:'500px', width:'100%'}})
