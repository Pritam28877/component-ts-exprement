Component: Silk
Category: background

Visual: Full-bleed silky fabric shader—soft ribbon-like waves with a tinted color wash; spans the entire container.
Behavior: Procedural fragment shader animates flowing interference patterns; speed, scale, rotation, and grain/noise are uniform-driven; continuous animation, resizes with viewport.

Good for: hero backgrounds, section breaks, ambient landing headers
Avoid for: dense copy sections, form pages, analytics dashboards
Website types: luxury/ecommerce, creative portfolios, music/entertainment

Dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber
Performance: medium (can trend heavy at high DPR or large canvases)
Mobile: yes
Container: Give the parent a fixed height and position: relative (e.g., width: 100%; height: 400–800px). The Canvas fills the parent; layer foreground content above it with absolute positioning and a higher z-index if needed. Lower DPR or reduce scale for mobile if performance dips.
