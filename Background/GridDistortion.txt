Component: GridDistortion
Category: background/hero/interaction

Visual: Full-bleed image plane with subtle, grid-based displacement; scales to fill its parent
Behavior: Mouse velocity displaces a data-texture grid causing elastic ripples; gradually relaxes back over time

Good for: hero banners, section backgrounds, media galleries
Avoid for: text-heavy content blocks, forms, critical CTA areas (possible legibility issues)
Website types: creative portfolios, product/brand sites, tech/SaaS landing pages

Dependencies: three
Performance: medium
Mobile: yes (renders; add touch handlers for interaction)

Installation: npm install three
