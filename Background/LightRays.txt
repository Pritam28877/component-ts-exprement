Component: LightRays
Category: background

Visual: Subtle volumetric “god rays” spilling from an edge or corner (configurable), softly tinted by color; full-bleed over the section.
Behavior: Procedural rays rendered in WebGL; origin and direction set by `raysOrigin`; animated by time with speed, spread, length; optional pulsating, noise, distortion; can ease toward mouse direction with adjustable influence; pauses when off-screen via IntersectionObserver.

Good for: hero headers, CTA strips, section dividers
Avoid for: dense text paragraphs, data tables, form-heavy pages
Website types: creative portfolios, music/entertainment, tech/SaaS landing pages

Dependencies: ogl, IntersectionObserver (native browser)
Performance: medium (alpha canvas + per-frame shader; keep DPR ≤ 2)
Mobile: yes
Container: Place inside a relatively positioned block with explicit height (e.g., width:100%; height:400–800px). Component injects a full-size transparent canvas; overlay foreground content above it (higher z-index). For performance on mobile, prefer smaller heights and default `mouseInfluence` low or `followMouse={false}`.
