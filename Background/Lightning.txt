Component: Lightning
Category: background/hero

Visual: Full-bleed WebGL canvas with branching, electric streaks tinted by hue; scales to container (commonly full-width, 400â€“800px tall hero).
Behavior: Procedural FBM shader animates crackling lightning that shimmers horizontally; speed, brightness, thickness, and offset are controllable via props.

Good for: hero, section dividers, concert/event headers
Avoid for: dense text blocks, forms/inputs, long-read articles

Website types: gaming, tech/startups, music/events

Dependencies: React (WebGL via browser, no extra libs)
Performance: medium (GPU shader; \~1 draw call but continuous animation)
Mobile: yes (falls back if WebGL unavailable; consider reducing intensity/size on low-end devices)
Container: Position a relatively sized wrapper with explicit height; e.g., style={{ width: '100%', height: '600px', position: 'relative' }}. Canvas fills parent; ensure sufficient contrast for overlaid content (add backdrop blur/overlay if placing text on top).
