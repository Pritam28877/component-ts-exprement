Component: Particles
Category: background/hero/interaction

Visual: A 3D cloud of soft circular particles (points) drifting/rotating in depth; fills whatever width/height the parent provides (e.g., 600px tall).

Behavior: GPU point sprites with sine-wave motion; optional hover parallax shifts the entire particle cluster; slow auto-rotation unless disabled.

Good for: hero, section-backgrounds, decorative banners
Avoid for: dense text blocks, forms, data-heavy tables
Website types: SaaS landing, creative/agency portfolio, events/music

Dependencies: react, ogl
Performance: medium (GPU accelerated; hundreds of particles OK)
Mobile: yes

Container: Place inside a parent with explicit size and position: relative (e.g., style={{width:'100%', height:'600px', position:'relative'}}). The canvas is transparent; ensure underlying background as needed.
