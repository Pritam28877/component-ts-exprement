Component: Waves
Category: background/hero/interaction

Visual: Full-bleed animated wireframe of parallel lines forming a flowing grid; thin strokes over a translucent/solid background. Scales to fill its parent.
Behavior: Canvas 2D animation using Perlin noise; continuous wave motion on X/Y. Cursor/touch adds springy displacement with friction/tension. Speeds/amps, line gaps, and cursor influence are tunable via props.

Good for: hero backgrounds, section separators/banners, subtle motion behind headlines
Avoid for: dense body copy (legibility), data tables/forms, legal/compliance pages
Website types: creative studios, SaaS/tech landing pages, fintech/web3, events/conferences

Dependencies: React (no external libs)
Performance: medium (single canvas render loop; fine on modern devices)
Mobile: yes (touch supported)
Container: Place inside a parent with explicit height and `position: relative`; component itself is `position: absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%` and will cover the parent. Adjust parent height (e.g., 400â€“800px) to control visual size.
