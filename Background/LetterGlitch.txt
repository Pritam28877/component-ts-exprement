Component: LetterGlitch
Category: background

Visual: Dense grid of mono-spaced letters/symbols on a dark canvas; subtle radial vignettes optional; scales to fill its container
Behavior: Random “glitch” swaps of characters and colors at a set interval; optional smooth color interpolation; responsive resize; purely canvas-based

Good for: hero backdrops, 404/maintenance screens, section dividers
Avoid for: text-heavy body content behind readable text, forms, data tables
Website types: tech SaaS, cybersecurity/infosec, gaming/esports

Dependencies: react (no external libs)
Performance: medium (canvas draw per frame; grid size scales with container)
Mobile: yes (but large containers increase draw cost)
Container: Give the parent a fixed/explicit size (e.g., style={{ width:'100%', height:'600px', position:'relative' }}); dark background recommended for contrast
