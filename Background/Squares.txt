Visual: Animated square grid on a canvas; fills its parent container
Behavior: Grid scrolls continuously (up/down/left/right/diagonal) at set speed; hovered cell fills with a highlight color; subtle radial vignette overlay

Good for: hero backgrounds, section dividers, CTA strips
Avoid for: dense text blocks, forms with many inputs, pages needing strict high-contrast accessibility
Website types: SaaS landing pages, creative portfolios, product marketing sites

Dependencies: React, CSS
Performance: light
Mobile: yes
Container: Give the canvas a sized parent (e.g., min-height or fixed height) and let it stretch to 100% width/height; example: a relative container with height: 400â€“600px and overflow: hidden
