Component: FaultyTerminal
Category: background/hero/interaction

Visual: Retro “faulty CRT/terminal” grid of glowing digits with scanlines, subtle curvature, flicker, and optional chromatic aberration; fills its parent.
Behavior: Procedural shader renders a digit matrix with noise/fbm; supports glitch/jitter, scanline bars, per-cell page-load reveal, mouse-reactive ripples/focus, tinting, dither, and brightness control.

Good for: hero sections, promo banners, 404/maintenance screens
Avoid for: dense long-form text, legal/policy pages, form-heavy flows

Website types: gaming, cyberpunk/tech brands, creative studios

Dependencies: ogl (WebGL)
Performance: medium (fragment shader heavy; tune digitSize/gridMul/effects)
Mobile: yes (prefer lower timeScale, disable heavy effects like high chromaticAberration/dither)
Container: Provide a sized, relatively positioned parent (e.g., style={{width:'100%',height:'600px',position:'relative'}}). Component appends a canvas and fills the parent; set overflow\:hidden. Place foreground content above with higher z-index; consider pointer-events\:none if purely decorative. Adjust dpr≤2 on mobile for smoothness.
