Component: LiquidChrome
Category: background

Visual: Full-bleed liquid metal/chrome waves with glossy shading; fills its container (e.g., 100% width × \~400–800px height)
Behavior: Shader-based ripples and sine-wave distortions that flow over time; optional mouse/touch interaction adds localized ripples and parallax-like warping

Good for: hero, section transitions, feature highlights
Avoid for: long text blocks, dense forms, low-power pages

Website types: creative studios, SaaS/landing pages, media/entertainment

Dependencies: react, ogl
Performance: medium-to-heavy (fragment shader with iterative warping and 3×3 sampling)
Mobile: yes (recommend disabling interaction or lowering amplitude/speed on small screens)
Container: parent must set explicit width/height and position (e.g., relative; 100% width × fixed/min height); canvas is appended to the container and resizes with it
