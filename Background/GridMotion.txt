Component: GridMotion
Category: background/hero/gallery/layout

Visual: A large, tilted (≈‑15°) 4×7 card grid (≈150vw × 150vh) with image/text tiles; dark cards with rounded corners and optional image fills.
Behavior: Rows shift horizontally in response to mouse X with alternating directions and eased inertia (GSAP ticker). Continuous parallax-style motion.

Good for: hero sections, showcase/grids, visual galleries
Avoid for: text-heavy reading sections, form pages, accessibility-critical content (motion sensitivity)
Website types: creative portfolios, SaaS/landing pages, studios/events

Dependencies: gsap
Performance: medium (GPU-friendly transforms; image loads can increase cost)
Mobile: no (mouse-only by default; add touch/tilt/autoplay for mobile)
Container: Parent must have explicit size (e.g., full-viewport section). Example: a wrapper with width: 100%; height: 100vh (or any fixed height).
