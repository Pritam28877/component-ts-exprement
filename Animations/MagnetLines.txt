Component: MagnetLines
Category: background

Visual: A square grid of slim lines (sticks) that rotate around their centers; size is the given container (e.g., 60–80vmin) and each cell holds one line.
Behavior: Lines continuously rotate to face the pointer using per-cell angle math; initializes at `baseAngle` and updates on `pointermove`.

Good for: hero backdrops, section dividers/visual separators, empty states
Avoid for: dense text areas (distraction), performance-critical above-the-fold content on low-end devices, motion-sensitive contexts without a reduce-motion fallback
Website types: creative/portfolio, tech/SaaS, gaming/entertainment

Dependencies: react
Performance: light (grid updates via style transform; cost scales with rows×columns)
Mobile: yes (pointer events supported on modern mobile)
Container: Component renders a square CSS grid with explicit width/height (`containerSize`); keep it in a relatively spacious area, avoid heavy overlapping filters, and consider `prefers-reduced-motion` handling if used full-screen.
