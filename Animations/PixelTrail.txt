Component: PixelTrail
Category: background/hero/interaction

Visual: Full-bleed pixel grid where dots “light up” in your cursor/touch path; looks like a soft, gooey trail of white pixels. Scales to fill the container (typically 500–800px tall hero/backdrop).
Behavior: Pointer/touch movement writes into a trail texture; grid cells sample it and fade out over time. Optional SVG “gooey” filter blends dots for a liquid effect.

Good for: hero backgrounds, section dividers, interactive canvases
Avoid for: dense text blocks, form-heavy sections, long lists/tables
Website types: creative studios, tech SaaS, gaming/esports, portfolios

Dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei
Performance: medium (can become heavy with large gridSize or strong goo filter)
Mobile: yes (touch supported; consider reducing gridSize/maxAge on low-end devices)
Container: Parent must be position: relative; fixed height; overflow: hidden (e.g., \<div style={{ height: 500, position: 'relative', overflow: 'hidden' }} />). The Canvas is absolutely positioned; ensure it sits behind content (z-index) or wrap it in its own layer if you need overlays.
