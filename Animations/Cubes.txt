Component: Cubes
Category: background/hero/interaction

Visual: A 2D grid of cube “faces” (square tiles) with borders; tiles tilt in 3D around the cursor and flash as ripples. Typically fills a square area (\~400–700px) inside its parent.
Behavior: Pointer movement tilts nearby tiles toward/away based on distance (radius, maxAngle, easing). Optional idle auto-animate sweeps a simulated cursor. Click creates concentric color ripples; tiles reset on pointer leave.

Good for: hero backgrounds, section intros, interactive brand moments
Avoid for: text-heavy content blocks, form pages, data tables
Website types: creative studios, AI/tech SaaS, gaming/entertainment

Dependencies: gsap
Performance: medium (heavier with larger gridSize, shadows, frequent ripples)
Mobile: yes (pointer/touch supported; consider smaller gridSize on low-end devices)

Installation: npm install gsap
Usage: <Cubes gridSize={8} maxAngle={60} radius={4} borderStyle="2px dashed #5227FF" faceColor="#1a1a2e" rippleColor="#ff6b6b" rippleSpeed={1.5} autoAnimate={true} rippleOnClick={true} />
Container: Place inside a relatively positioned parent with a defined height; component renders a square area. Defaults to a square with class "w-1/2 aspect-square"—override via your CSS if you need full-width or a fixed pixel size.
