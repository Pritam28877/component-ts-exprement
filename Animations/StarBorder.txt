Component: StarBorder
Category: interaction

Visual: A rounded button/card with a subtle starry glow that sweeps along the top and bottom edges, creating a luminous animated border around the content.
Behavior: Two radial-gradient “star bands” slide in opposite directions (CSS keyframes). Speed and color are configurable; thickness controls the apparent border width.

Good for: hero CTAs, feature cards, pricing toggles
Avoid for: dense forms/tables, ultra-minimalist layouts, motion-sensitive areas without a toggle
Website types: creative/agency, SaaS marketing, portfolios

Dependencies: React, Tailwind CSS (custom keyframes). GSAP not required.
Performance: light (pure CSS animations)
Mobile: yes
Container: Renders as an inline-block, position: relative, overflow-hidden, rounded container. Ensure Tailwind has the provided keyframes (`star-movement-top`/`bottom`) and apply a visible background behind the animated bands (component includes a default dark gradient—you can override via className).
