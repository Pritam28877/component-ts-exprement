Component: Magnet
Category: interaction

Visual: Any inline-block child (text, button, card) subtly “pulls” toward the mouse as it nears; no size change, just a smooth positional nudge.
Behavior: Listens to global mousemove; within a padded zone around the element it translates toward the pointer by (dx/magnetStrength, dy/magnetStrength). Snaps back with configurable active/inactive transitions.

Good for: CTAs/buttons, badges/chips, small promo cards
Avoid for: long text paragraphs, dense form fields, critical precision controls (sliders, tiny icons)
Website types: SaaS marketing, portfolios/creative, e‑commerce product cards

Dependencies: react
Performance: light
Mobile: no (mouse-only; no touch handlers)

Installation: None
Usage: <Magnet padding={50} disabled={false} magnetStrength={50} activeTransition="transform 0.25s ease-out" inactiveTransition="transform 0.45s ease">Star React Bits on GitHub!</Magnet>
Container: Renders an inline-block wrapper (position: relative). Ensure there’s visual room around the element for the offset; avoid clipping parents (overflow: hidden) unless intended. Consider adding a `prefers-reduced-motion` gate if used widely.
