Component: Noise
Category: background/hero/interaction

Visual: Full‑screen, subtle film‑grain layer (black/white speckles) that sits over content; reads as fine texture. Covers the entire viewport by default (stretches to parent if constrained).
Behavior: A canvas regenerates random grayscale pixels each frame interval; opacity controls grain strength. (Note: current code mainly uses `patternRefreshInterval` and `patternAlpha`; scale/size props are present but not actively applied to rendering density.)

Good for: hero backdrops, section separators, minimal pages needing texture
Avoid for: text‑heavy forms, data tables, image galleries that need perfect clarity
Website types: creative portfolios, editorial/fashion, minimalist SaaS/landing pages

Dependencies: none
Performance: light (very small per‑frame work; increase interval for ultra‑low CPU)
Mobile: yes
Container: The component renders an absolutely positioned, pointer‑events‑none canvas sized to the viewport (`h-screen w-screen`). Place inside a relatively positioned wrapper if you want it clipped to that area; otherwise it will cover the full screen. Adjust z-index if you need content above it.
