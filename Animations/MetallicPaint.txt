Component: MetallicPaint
Category: hero/background/interaction

Visual: A glossy, liquid‑metal logo mask with shifting chrome-like stripes and subtle color dispersion; reads as a premium metallic sheen. Typically fills its container (internally renders to a high‑DPI \~1000×1000 canvas).
Behavior: WebGL2 fragment shader animates reflective bands, refraction, and “liquid” wobble over time; the logo acts as a mask (white background outside, metallic inside). Speed, edge falloff, refraction, blur, and stripe scale are parameterized.

Good for: hero logo lockups, brand reveal sections, premium product banners
Avoid for: dense text blocks, low-contrast content areas, battery‑sensitive pages
Website types: luxury/automotive/fashion, AI/fintech SaaS, creative portfolios

Dependencies: none (runs on WebGL2 in-browser; React component)
Performance: medium–heavy (GPU shader; depends on device/GPU)
Mobile: yes (requires WebGL2 support; consider lower speed/liquid on low‑end devices)

Installation: None
Usage: \<MetallicPaint imageData={imageData} params={{ edge: 2, patternBlur: 0.005, patternScale: 2, refraction: 0.015, speed: 0.3, liquid: 0.07 }} />
Container: Wrap in a block with explicit size (e.g., width: 100%; height: 60–100vh). The canvas is square and high‑DPI; ensure the SVG/logo has padding and black fill to expose the effect. Use parseLogoImage(file) to convert SVG/PNG to ImageData before passing to the component.
