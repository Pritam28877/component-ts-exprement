Component: AnimatedContent
Category: interaction

Visual: Wraps any element; starts offset (x/y), slightly scaled and faded; animates into place at full size and opacity. Size matches its child content.
Behavior: One-time scroll-reveal using GSAP ScrollTrigger; moves from offset to 0 on the chosen axis, scales to 1, and fades in with configurable easing, duration, delay, and threshold.

Good for: hero sub-elements, feature cards/grids, stats/metrics blocks
Avoid for: primary navbar (LCP/CLS risk), critical form inputs above the fold, continuously looping galleries
Website types: SaaS/tech, e‑commerce, portfolios

Dependencies: react, gsap, gsap/ScrollTrigger
Performance: medium
Mobile: yes
Container: Ensure the wrapper isn’t clipped (avoid overflow: hidden on ancestor unless intentional); add CSS like `will-change: transform, opacity;` on the child for smoother rendering; no special positioning required.
