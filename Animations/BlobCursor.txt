Component: BlobCursor
Category: interaction/background

Visual: Soft, glowing blobs (circle or square) that trail the cursor; each blob has a smaller inner “highlight” and optional gooey/blur filter. Sits on top of content.
Behavior: Lead blob snaps to pointer (fast tween), followers ease-in (slower tween) creating a trailing effect. Mouse and touch supported; optional SVG filter for metaball-like merging/glow.

Good for: hero overlays, playful landing pages, feature sections with minimal inputs
Avoid for: form-heavy pages, dense tables/dashboards, strict-accessibility areas without a motion toggle
Website types: creative/agency, SaaS marketing, portfolios

Dependencies: react, gsap
Performance: light–medium (DOM + GSAP tweens; SVG filter increases cost)
Mobile: yes (touch move supported)
Container: A relatively positioned wrapper that covers the intended area (e.g., class="relative w-full h-full"). The drawable layer is pointer-events: none, so underlying UI remains clickable. For full-page overlays, mount inside a full-viewport container and set a high z-index; reduce filterStdDeviation/disable useFilter on low-end devices.
