Component: GlareHover
Category: interaction

Visual: A framed block (default 500×500) with content centered; a diagonal glossy “glare” sweep passes over the surface, creating a premium, reflective highlight.
Behavior: On hover, a linear‑gradient highlight animates from off‑canvas to across the element; exits on mouse leave (or stays if playOnce=true). Angle, size, color, opacity, and speed are configurable.

Good for: hero headlines/cards, product tiles, CTA cards
Avoid for: primary navigation items, body text blocks, performance‑sensitive lists with many items
Website types: luxury/e‑commerce, creative/portfolio, SaaS marketing

Dependencies: react
Performance: light
Mobile: limited (no touch handlers by default)
Container: Component is self‑contained with position\:relative and overflow\:hidden; ensure a defined width/height (via props or style). Avoid heavy backdrop/filters on ancestors; content is centered with CSS grid.
