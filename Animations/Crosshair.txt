Component: Crosshair
Category: interaction/navigation/background

Visual: Two thin lines (horizontal & vertical) crossing at the cursor’s position, creating a targeting crosshair overlay. Lines are full-width/height, with optional noise distortion when hovering over links.
Behavior: Tracks mouse movement within the container (or window), smoothly interpolates position (lerp), fades lines in/out based on pointer entry/exit, and triggers a turbulence filter ripple effect when hovering over links.

Good for: interactive showcases, design portfolios, creative navigation cues
Avoid for: standard form pages, content-dense articles, minimalistic layouts without motion
Website types: creative agency, gaming/eSports, tech product landing pages

Dependencies: gsap
Performance: light (small DOM updates, occasional SVG filter animations)
Mobile: no (touch devices won’t benefit without adaptation)

Installation: npm install gsap
Usage: `<Crosshair containerRef={containerRef} color="#ffffff" />`
Container: Place inside a relatively or fixed-position container that matches the interaction bounds. If `containerRef` is omitted, defaults to tracking the whole window. Ensure `overflow: hidden` if you want to clip the crosshair lines to the container.
