Component: PixelTransition
Category: interaction

Visual: A card-sized container (default 300px wide) showing one piece of content that transitions to another via a randomized pixelation effect. The grid of pixels briefly covers the content before revealing the alternate state.
Behavior: On hover (desktop) or tap (mobile), a grid of colored "pixels" animates in random sequence, hiding the current content and revealing the alternate. Can toggle back and forth; uses GSAP staggered animations for pixel reveal/hide.

Good for: product cards, portfolio item previews, interactive gallery thumbnails
Avoid for: primary navigation items, large hero banners (performance-heavy), critical above-the-fold elements with high LCP sensitivity
Website types: creative portfolios, e-commerce, entertainment/media

Dependencies: react, gsap
Performance: medium-heavy (depends on grid size; many DOM nodes for high grids)
Mobile: yes (click/tap toggles instead of hover)

Installation: npm install gsap
Usage: `<PixelTransition firstContent={<img ... />} secondContent={<div>...</div>} gridSize={12} pixelColor="#fff" animationStepDuration={0.4} />`
Container: Must have fixed aspect ratio (provided via `aspectRatio` prop) and `overflow:hidden`; avoid wrapping in elements that disrupt relative positioning; size content with `width` and `max-width` as desired.
