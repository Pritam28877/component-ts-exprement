Component: CurvedLoop
Category: text\_animation/interaction

Visual: A wide, curved SVG marquee where bold uppercase text flows along a gentle arc across the viewport; looks like a wavy headline strip spanning full width (height \~12% of width by default).
Behavior: Continuously scrolls the text along an SVG path; speed and direction are configurable. When interactive, users can drag to scrub the marquee and the auto-scroll resumes in the drag direction.

Good for: hero banners, section separators, announcement tickers
Avoid for: long paragraphs, compliance/legal copy, key SEO headings that must remain static
Website types: creative portfolios, marketing/landing pages, event or product launch sites

Dependencies: react (SVG/TextPath APIs in browser)
Performance: light–medium (rAF updating a single textPath offset; repeats text to fill width)
Mobile: yes (pointer-based dragging supported)

Installation: None
Usage: <CurvedLoop marqueeText="Be ✦ Creative ✦ With ✦ React ✦ Bits ✦" speed={3} curveAmount={500} direction="right" interactive={true} className="custom-text-style" />
Container: Works best in a wide container; component renders a full-width SVG with aspect ratio \~100:12 and large font size (text-\[6rem]). Ensure sufficient vertical space so the curve (controlled by curveAmount) isn’t clipped; avoid overflow hidden if you want full glow/shadow styles from custom classes.
