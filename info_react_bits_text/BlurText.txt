Component: BlurText
Category: text\_animation

Visual: Inline paragraph where each word/letter appears soft and out-of-focus at first, then sharpens while sliding in (up or down). Renders at content width; spans wrap naturally (flex-wrap) so it fits any text block size.
Behavior: Uses IntersectionObserver to trigger once in view; each segment animates keyframed blur→less blur→crisp with opacity and Y-translation. Segments are staggered by `delay`; supports animating by words or letters; fires `onAnimationComplete` after the last segment finishes.

Good for: hero headlines, section intros, feature callouts
Avoid for: long body paragraphs, rapidly changing dynamic text, data-heavy tables
Website types: SaaS marketing, portfolios/creative, editorial landing pages

Dependencies: react, motion (motion/react), motion-utils (for easing types), optional tailwindcss for styling classes
Performance: light/medium (GPU transforms + blur filter per segment; fine for typical headings)
Mobile: yes

Installation: npm install motion
Usage: \<BlurText text="Isn't this so cool?!" delay={150} animateBy="words" direction="top" threshold={0.1} rootMargin="0px" stepDuration={0.35} onAnimationComplete={() => {}} className="text-2xl mb-8" />
Container: Place inside a text container with adequate line-height; the component sets `display:flex` and `flex-wrap` on the paragraph, so allow horizontal space for wrapping. Avoid heavy parent transforms/filters that could compound blur. Keep background contrast high so the blur-to-crisp transition reads clearly.
