Component: Stepper
Category: interaction

Visual: Horizontal step indicators (numbered circles with connecting line) above a card-sized content area; default max width \~md (≈28–32rem) and responsive center layout.
Behavior: Animates step changes with sliding transitions; supports clicking indicators to jump, Back/Next controls, and a final “Complete” state; calls `onStepChange` and `onFinalStepCompleted` callbacks.

Good for: multi-step forms, onboarding wizards, checkout flows
Avoid for: single-field quick actions, very long forms without logical grouping, content where step order isn’t linear
Website types: SaaS dashboards, e-commerce, education/course platforms

Dependencies: react, motion/react (Framer Motion)
Performance: light
Mobile: yes
Container: place within a centered container; allow width up to \~max-w-md; ensure sufficient vertical space; component uses Tailwind-like classes but can be styled via provided className props.
