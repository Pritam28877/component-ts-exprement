Component: GlassSurface
Category: background/hero/layout/interaction

Visual: Frosted “glass” card with rounded corners; default \~200×80 but can be any width/height.
Behavior: Uses SVG filter + backdrop-filter to create blur, brightness, chromatic aberration, and edge glow; displacement/RGB offsets and blend mode are customizable; auto-recomputes on resize and adapts to dark/light mode.

Good for: hero callouts, stat/feature cards, CTA panels
Avoid for: dense body text, low-contrast backgrounds, long scroll lists

Website types: SaaS landing pages, dashboards/fintech, portfolios

Dependencies: React (no extra libs). *Install step shown (lenis) isn’t required.*
Performance: light-to-medium (SVG/backdrop filters; fine for most cards)
Mobile: yes (has fallbacks for Safari/Firefox/backdrop-filter unsupported cases)
Container: Give an explicit size via props or parent CSS; component fills its box and inherits border-radius; keep some background behind it for the glass effect to read.
