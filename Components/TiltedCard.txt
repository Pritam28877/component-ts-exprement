Component: TiltedCard
Category: interaction/gallery

Visual: A 3D tilt-hover image card with optional overlay content and tooltip; typically small to medium size (e.g., 300Ã—300px) with smooth scaling on hover.
Behavior: Tilts in response to mouse movement, scales up slightly on hover, displays an animated tooltip following the cursor, and can show overlay content with depth via `translateZ`.

Good for: product previews, album covers, portfolio thumbnails
Avoid for: text-heavy blocks, static imagery without interaction needs, performance-sensitive mobile-first grids
Website types: e-commerce, music/entertainment, creative portfolios

Dependencies: motion/react (Framer Motion), lenis
Performance: medium
Mobile: no (desktop-optimized, mobile warning option)
Container: fixed-size or responsive container with `perspective` and centered flex layout; should match `containerHeight`/`containerWidth` to image size for best effect
