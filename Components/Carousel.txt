Component: Carousel
Category: gallery/hero/interaction

Visual: A horizontal card slider with 3D tilt—each slide rotates slightly on the Y-axis while moving; supports circular “round” mode (perfect circle slides) or standard rounded rectangles. Size driven by `baseWidth` (e.g., 300px) and parent height.

Behavior: Drag/swipe to move; spring-based snapping; optional autoplay with delay and pause-on-hover; optional seamless loop using a cloned last slide and instant reset; dots indicate and set the active slide.

Good for: hero feature highlights, product/module overviews, testimonials
Avoid for: long-form text, SEO-critical content that must be fully visible server-side, dense data tables

Website types: SaaS marketing, portfolios, app landing pages

Dependencies: react, motion/react (Framer Motion v3 API); optional react-icons, Tailwind CSS
Performance: light–medium (GPU transforms + spring animations; content size and autoplay frequency affect cost)
Mobile: yes (touch drag supported; dots are tap targets)
Container: wrap in a relatively positioned container with an explicit height (e.g., 600px) and enough width; component sets its own width via `baseWidth`; ensure `overflow: hidden` for the viewport and provide bottom space for dots in “round” mode.
