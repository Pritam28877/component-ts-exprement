Component: RollingGallery
Category: gallery

Visual: A 3D cylindrical carousel of image cards (approx 300×120px each) arranged in a ring, viewed with perspective; default container height \~500px, full-width.
Behavior: Infinite linear spin when `autoplay` is true (20s per revolution), draggable on X to rotate, optional pause on hover (`pauseOnHover`), responsive cylinder width (≈1800px desktop / 1100px small screens), smooth GPU 3D transforms.

Good for: hero showcases, portfolio galleries, brand/logo reels
Avoid for: text-heavy content, accessibility-critical image grids, SEO-focused image lists needing plain markup
Website types: creative agency, fashion/ecommerce lookbooks, product/SaaS marketing

Dependencies: react, motion/react (Framer Motion)
Performance: medium
Mobile: yes (drag to rotate; reduced cylinder width)
Container: parent should be `position: relative`, `height: ~500px`, `overflow: hidden`; component applies `perspective:1000px` and uses Tailwind utility classes (or equivalent CSS).
