Component: Lanyard
Category: interaction/hero

Visual: A 3D ID card clipped to a textured lanyard band, hanging in space with studio-style reflections; typically full-viewport height.
Behavior: Real-time physics rope sim; card swings with gravity, reacts to pointer drag (grab/grabbed cursor), band deforms along a Catmull–Rom curve; subtle damping and lightformers add glints.

Good for: hero sections, product/ID mockups, event or conference pages
Avoid for: dense content pages, text-heavy article layouts, low-power landing variants

Website types: tech SaaS, portfolios, events/conferences

Dependencies: three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, @react-three/rapier, meshline, (assets: card.glb, lanyard.png; Vite assetsInclude for \*.glb; optional TS module decls)
Performance: medium–heavy (WebGL + physics)
Mobile: yes (works, but heavier; component adapts resolution on small screens)
Container: A sized parent (e.g., full-viewport div). Canvas uses transparent background; ensure `height: 100vh` and `position: relative`.
