Component: Masonry
Category: gallery/layout/interaction

Visual: Responsive masonry grid of image tiles with variable heights; items are absolutely positioned with gaps, rounded corners, and soft shadows; fills available width and grows vertically.
Behavior: Preloads images, then animates items into place with GSAP (from top/bottom/left/right/center/random); smooth reflow on resize; optional blur-to-focus entrance; optional hover scale and color overlay; clickable tiles open links.

Good for: portfolios, photo galleries, inspiration boards
Avoid for: text-heavy listings, strict row/column grids that require alignment, low-GPU devices with massive image counts
Website types: creative studios, blogs/magazines, e-commerce lookbooks

Dependencies: react, gsap, (optional: lenis for smooth page scroll)
Performance: medium (animation + many images; scales with item count)
Mobile: yes (column count adapts via media queries)
Container: a relatively positioned, full-width container with explicit height or content-driven height; ensure adequate vertical space and consider lazy-loading for long grids
