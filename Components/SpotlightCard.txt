Component: SpotlightCard
Category: background/interaction

Visual: A rounded, dark card with a soft radial “spotlight” glow that follows the cursor; padding-heavy content area (default p-8), subtle border.
Behavior: On hover, a radial-gradient spotlight appears and tracks pointer; on focus it locks in (higher opacity) and fades out on blur/leave.

Good for: feature highlights, CTA tiles, pricing/plan cards
Avoid for: dense long-form text, strict WCAG-high-contrast layouts, pages with heavy overlapping hover effects

Website types: SaaS marketing, portfolios, dashboards

Dependencies: react (optional Tailwind for provided classes)
Performance: light
Mobile: yes (focus/tap shows glow; no pointer tracking)
Container: place inside a relatively sized section; card is self-contained with `position: relative`, `overflow: hidden`, and rounded corners—ensure sufficient padding and a background where the glow has contrast.
