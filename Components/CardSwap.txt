Component: CardSwap
Category: gallery/interaction/hero

Visual: A small stack of skewed 3D cards (default \~500Ã—400) overlapping, anchored to the bottom-right of its parent with perspective depth.
Behavior: Every few seconds the front card drops down, moves to the back, and the rest shift forward with elastic easing; optional pause on hover; cards are clickable.

Good for: testimonials, feature highlights, portfolio previews
Avoid for: long-form text, accessibility-critical content, dense data cards
Website types: SaaS marketing, creative studios, personal portfolios

Dependencies: react, gsap, (tailwind classes used for styling)
Performance: medium
Mobile: yes (responsive transforms applied; consider fewer/smaller cards)
Container: parent should be position: relative; give it a fixed height; component itself is absolutely positioned with 3D perspective and overflow visible
