Component: FlowingMenu
Category: navigation/interaction/layout

Visual: Full-height vertical menu where each row is a large, centered label; on hover, a white panel slides in and reveals a horizontal marquee mixing the label text and a thumbnail image.
Behavior: Direction-aware slide (from top/bottom based on cursor entry); inside panel, content continuously scrolls left via CSS keyframes; panel slides out on leave.

Good for: featured category menus, section nav with previews, landing-page hero menus
Avoid for: dense multi-level nav, small sidebars, accessibility-critical primary nav without clear focus states
Website types: creative studios, product/OS showcase pages, editorial/magazine portals

Dependencies: react, gsap, tailwindcss (custom keyframes/utility for 101% translate)
Performance: light (simple GSAP transforms + CSS marquee)
Mobile: yes (works visually; hover effects won’t trigger—consider tap-to-toggle for the marquee)
Container: parent should be position: relative and sized (e.g., height: 100%/fixed like 600px); menu fills width/height; ensure Tailwind config adds `translate['101'] = '101%'` and `animation: { marquee }` for the scrolling row
