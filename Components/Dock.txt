Component: Dock
Category: navigation/interaction

Visual: A macOS-style floating dock with circular icon buttons, centered at the bottom; typically \~64â€“256px tall depending on hover state.
Behavior: Icons smoothly magnify toward the cursor using spring physics; labels fade/slide up on hover; panel height expands when dock is active and collapses when idle.

Good for: app shells, dashboards, portfolios
Avoid for: long text articles, complex forms (mobile keyboard overlap), minimal-JS landing pages

Website types: SaaS/product sites, developer portfolios, web apps

Dependencies: react, motion/react (Framer Motion v3 API), (optional) react-icons, (optional) Tailwind CSS for the provided classes
Performance: light
Mobile: yes (tap works; hover tooltips limited)
Container: place in a full-width container; ensure bottom spacing (`bottom: .5rem`) and high z-index; if you need it relative to a section, wrap in a `position: relative` parent since the dock uses `position: absolute` and centers with `left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%)`.
