Component: ElasticSlider
Category: interaction/layout

Visual: Compact horizontal slider (\~12rem wide by default) with a thin rounded track, a filled progress bar, and left/right icon buttons.
Behavior: Drag anywhere on the track to set value; overscroll past track edges produces an elastic stretch and icon “bounce.” Supports stepped increments, hover/touch scale-up, and animated return on release.

Good for: numeric controls (volume/brightness), pricing/config sliders, compact settings UIs
Avoid for: precise form inputs needing keyboard entry, very large ranges without labels, accessibility-critical controls without ARIA/keyboard support
Website types: SaaS dashboards, media players, product configurators

Dependencies: react, framer-motion (imported as motion/react)
Performance: light–medium (motion values + rAF transforms)
Mobile: yes (pointer/touch handled; consider larger hit areas)
Container: place inside a flex container; default wrapper width is `w-48` (\~12rem) but can be overridden via `className`; ensure enough horizontal space for icons and track
