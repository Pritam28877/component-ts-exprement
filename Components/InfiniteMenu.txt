Component: InfiniteMenu
Category: navigation/gallery/interaction

Visual: A 3D sphere of image-discs arranged in space; fills its parent (e.g., 600px-tall area) with overlaid title/description and a floating CTA button
Behavior: Click-drag/touch-drag to rotate the sphere; nearest front-facing disc becomes “active,” fading in its title/description and enabling a CTA; images are packed in a GPU atlas and smoothly scale with depth

Good for: feature menus, portfolio/project selectors, category hubs
Avoid for: text-heavy menus, SEO-critical nav links, very large item counts (>50) without pagination

Website types: creative studios, product/landing pages, galleries/portfolios

Dependencies: react, gl-matrix, WebGL2 (via canvas)
Performance: heavy (GPU/WebGL instancing + image atlas)
Mobile: yes (touch drag; modern devices recommended)
Container: parent must be positioned and sized (e.g., `position: relative; height: 600px;`); canvas stretches to `width: 100%; height: 100%`; ensure sufficient z-index for overlayed title/CTA and allow pointer events over canvas
